    title: "General Questions",
    description: `<b style='margin-left: 25px;'>What is cryptocurrency?</b><br/><br/>
Ð¡ryptocurrency is a digital currency that uses cryptography for security, feature, that makes it difficult to counterfeit. It is not issued by any central authority, rendering it theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.<br/><br/>
<b style='margin-left: 25px;'>How do I register?</b><br/><br/>
Registering is as simple as 1, 2, 3. Go to main page and register with your email address to get started. For registration, you will need a username and a password.<br/><br/>
<b style='margin-left: 25px;'>How do I get verified?</b><br/><br/>
For certain kinds of Exchange Cryptocurrency Platform payments profile transactions, we might need to verify your identity using information protecting your wallet. Verifying your identity helps prevent fraud and ensures that no one, except you, is able to use your payment information to make changes. You can make the first withdrawal of your funds to the wallet, which is registered and verified with your account. Click to Deposit at the left tab, select the minimum amount BTC that will be added to your account balance.<br/><br/>
<b style='margin-left: 25px;'>What is ID verification for?</b><br/><br/>
ID verification is needed to increase the security and reliability of the account. In case of loss of access to the mail to which the account is linked, you can always restore access with your Passport, driving license and other legal ID. In addition, verification allows you to increase daily withdrawal limits.<br/><br/>
<b style='margin-left: 25px;'>What is 2Factor Authentication (or 2FA)?</b><br/><br/>
We allow you to enable 2FA on your account by checking 2FA box in Personal Area  Settings. When making a deposit or withdrawal, you will receive a link to the confirmation of the operation by email. The confirmation link has a limited validity period. This greatly increases the security of your account because if your device is hacked into, or your password is compromised, the hacker will still not be able withdraw or transfer funds because they need access email, too. You may turn the verification off anytime you want.<br/><br/>
<b style='margin-left: 25px;'>I lost my 2Factor Device.</b><br/><br/>

    title: "Referral Program",
    description: `<b style='margin-left: 25px;'>How does it work?</b><br/><br/>
The referral system on our exchange is divided into three stages:
A :a group of people who registered directly with your link B :friends of your referrals, who, in turn, were invited by category A referrals and registered by their referral code C :registered users on a referral link of a referral from category B Thus, the domain.site referral system consists of three stages.<br/><br/>
<b style='margin-left: 25px;'>Who are referrals and why are they needed?</b><br/><br/>
A referral is a partner program participant who has registered on the recommendation of another participant. A referral is also a full-fledged user of the domain.site Exchange, without any restrictions. The person who brought the new member to the project will receive a commission (referral). Accordingly, the more people click on the link, the more passive earnings the referrer will have<br/><br/>
<b style='margin-left: 25px;'>What kind of reward awaits you?</b><br/><br/>
As we mentioned above, the updated referral system includes as many as three stages of referrals, respectively, the rewards will also vary for you depending on your category. For category A referrals you get 50% of the commission, category B referrals will bring you 10%, and for category C you will get 2.5% of the commission.<br/><br/>
For each referral you will receive your percentage, but this percentage will depend on the referral category: A, B or C.<br/><br/>
At the moment, the referral system and the ability to create an unlimited number of referral codes are only available to premium users.<br/><br/>
domain.site referral program packs these key features:<br/><br/>
No referral limits - You can refer as many friends as possible; you and your friends will each get refferal bonus in BTC equivalent after they complete their verification.<br/><br/>
Anyone can participate - Available for all eligible Trading users, no BTC/ETH/BCH staking required to refer friends.<br/><br/>
Bonus credited instantly - Your friends can use their sign-up bonus immediately after they passing verification.<br/><br/>
Get rewards for your friends deposit - For each new friend you will receive 0.01% (in BTC) of the sum of all his deposits.<br/><br/>

    title: "Risk Warning",
    description: `The trading of goods and products, real or virtual, as well as virtual currencies involves significant risk. Prices can and do fluctuate on any given day. Due to such price fluctuations, you may increase or lose value in your assets at any given moment. Any currency - virtual or not - may be subject to large swings in value and may even become worthless. There is an inherent risk that losses will occur as a result of buying, selling or trading anything on a market.<br/><br/>
Bitcoin trading also has special risks not generally shared with official currencies or goods or commodities in a market. Unlike most currencies, which are backed by governments or other legal entities, or by commodities such as gold or silver, Bitcoin is a unique kind of "fiat" currency, backed by technology and trust. There is no central bank that can take corrective measure to protect the value of Bitcoins in a crisis or issue more currency.<br/><br/>
Instead, Bitcoin is an as-yet autonomous and largely unregulated worldwide system of currency firms and individuals. Traders put their trust in a digital, decentralized and partially anonymous system that relies on peer-to-peer networking and cryptography to maintain its integrity.<br/><br/>
Bitcoin trading is probably susceptible to irrational (or rational) bubbles or loss of confidence, which could collapse demand relative to supply. For example, confidence might collapse in Bitcoin because of unexpected changes imposed by the software developers or others, a government crackdown, the creation of superior competing alternative currencies, or a deflationary or inflationary spiral. Confidence might also collapse because of technical problems: if the anonymity of the system is compromised, if money is lost or stolen, or if hackers or governments are able to prevent any transactions from settling.<br/><br/>
There may be additional risks that we have not foreseen or identified in our Terms of Use.<br/><br/>
You should carefully assess whether your financial situation and tolerance for risk is suitable for buying, selling or trading Bitcoins.<br/><br/>

    title: "Arbitrage",
    description: `This trading scheme for cryptocurrency exchanges is extremely simple. You buy cryptocurrency on one exchange at a low price and sell it on another exchange for as much as possible.<br/><br/>
<b>It is a simple and profitable cryptocurrency trading strategy on an exchange that only requires regular monitoring of exchange rates.</b> However, when counting on the possible earnings, you need to consider the commission that some exchanges charge. If the difference in the exchange rates of one currency on the exchanges is 2-3% or more, the sale can be profitable. If the exchange rate difference is less than 2%, the profit will be minimal or not at all.<br/><br/>
Let's say you bought 10 ETH at $210 ($2100) on one exchange, transferred them to your wallet and immediately sold on another exchange for $225 ($2250). Simple math again - your profit will be $150.<br/><br/>
It is worth noting that arbitrage on classic exchanges is a less profitable strategy that is available mainly to professionals. It takes a very fast robot to make money using arbitrage on traditional marketplaces. The response delay of the robot should be within 1 microsecond (one millionth of a second).<br/><br/>
On crypto exchanges, at least for now, robots that are a thousand times slower can still make money. With a relatively fast and smart algorithm, with this strategy you can earn up to 10% per month.<br/><br/>

    title: "Cryptocurrency overview",
    description: `<b style='margin-left: 25px;'>What is BTC (Bitcoin)?</b><br/><br/>
Bitcoin is a reward for the work done in the form of a code.<br/></br>
Bitcoin is the world's first cryptocurrency (decentralized digital currency). This currency is fundamentally different from all previously created electronic currencies and payment systems. It is not tied to any physical assets or official currencies, and the price of a digital coin - bitcoin - is governed solely by market supply and demand.<br/></br>
Bitcoin is also a worldwide payment system through which transactions with this currency can be carried out. Its main difference from traditional payment systems is that the Bitcoin system does not have any control and processing center - all transactions take place exclusively in a network of equal clients.<br/></br>
 
<b style='margin-left: 25px;'>What is BCH (Bitcoin Cash)?</b><br/></br>
Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency, a fork of Bitcoin that split from it. Forking from the main branch occurred on August 1, 2017. In 2018, Bitcoin SV peer-to-peer payment system branched off from Bitcoin Cash.<br/></br>
Any user who had Bitcoin at the time of the fork became the owner of an equivalent amount of Bitcoin Cash. To prevent double-spending, Bitcoin Cash transactions use a new signature hashing algorithm that is not valid on the Bitcoin Legacy network. This prevents replay of Bitcoin Cash transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain and vice versa.<br/></br>
The main difference from the "parent" cryptocurrency is the larger block size (8 MB instead of 1 MB), which favorably affects the speed of operations.<br/></br>
So what are the main differences between BCH and BTC? The new currency operates on a protocol similar to bitcoin: SHA-256 hash calculation algorithm; the same reward system and Proof of Work consensus; the same "ceiling" of emission - no more than 21 million coins can be issued But there are also a few key differences: the main difference is the block size increased by 8 times, up to 8 megabytes; the complexity change scheme is different: it does not change every 2016 blocks, like BTC, but every 6 Both currencies use the same Blockchain. Block number 478558 is the last of the common for both projects: the next one, 478559, is generated both in the BTC network and in BCH, but in different formats, which are mutually discarded by the blockchain branches of the "old" bitcoin and its fork. Thus, block 478559 became the first in the history of BCH.<br/></br>
Of the minor innovations of a technical nature, which also give an advantage, it can be noted: implementation of protection against erasure of transactions and their replay; a special type of transaction, where the user is given the opportunity to sign separately the amount of transfers, making payments safe<br/></br>
 
<b style="margin-left: 25px;">What is ETH (Ethereum)?</b><br/></br>
Ethereum is a decentralized platform with smart contracts: applications that work exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference.<br/></br>
These applications run on a custom blockchain, an extremely powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value and represent property ownership.<br/></br>
This allows developers to create markets, keep registers of debts or promises, transfer funds according to instructions given in the past (like a will or a futures contract) and many other things that have not yet been invented, all without a middle man or counterparty risk.<br/></br>
Ether is a necessary element - fuel - for the operation of the Ethereum distributed application platform. It is a form of payment made by clients of the platform for machines performing the requested transactions. In other words, ether is an incentive to ensure that developers write quality applications (wasteful code costs are greater) and that the network remains healthy (people are compensated for their resources).<br/></br>
 
<b style='margin-left: 25px;'>What is USDT (Tether USD)?</b><br/></br>
Tether converts money into digital currency, pegs the value to local currencies such as the US dollar, euro and yen.<br/></br>
As you know, blockchain has a number of advantages over traditional financial institutions as it offers cheap, fast, unlimited transactions without intermediaries. However, the volatility of exchange rates on the blockchain does not allow them to become widespread.<br/></br>
The company combines the technology used by bitcoin with fiat currencies to take advantage of blockchain technology using a currency backed by the US Treasury or the European Central Bank. According to CEO Reeve Collins, the company is digitizing the dollar and bringing that digital dollar to the blockchain.<br/></br>

    title: "Day Trading",
    description: `<b>Day traders are people who live off trading cryptocurrencies and spend most of their time trading.</b> Whether it's buying or selling assets, margin trading or swapping perpetual contracts, they make a dozen different trades every day, hoping to catch favorable price movements. The rewards can be overwhelming, but it can be a little daunting for newbies - especially if you don't know much about technical and fundamental analysis or have little experience in the markets. It can take months or even years of loss before you truly become a successful day trader.<br/></br>
In the cryptocurrency market, day traders have to stick to charts and watch price movements closely. Be prepared to cut losses, break even, and switch frequently to avoid bull or bear traps and losses. As a day trader, you have to befriend cryptocurrency price fluctuations and literally live by them no matter which direction the market is heading. There is a counter trade for every price movement at the pivot point, which is a great opportunity to increase the amount.<br/></br>
<b>Day trading is fast and accurate solutions designed to minimize risk and maximize your profits.</b> Of course, no trader can be 100% right, so be prepared to close positions even with significant losses. Learn to identify possible levels of support and resistance, re-enter your trades at the right time, set targets and also set stop loss, and sooner or later you will develop your day trader skill.<br/></br>

    title: "Creation of a crypto portfolio",
    description: `This sophisticated cryptocurrency trading strategy is based on assessing the state of the cryptocurrency market. To use it effectively, it is necessary not only to monitor the situation on the cryptocurrency market, but also to take into account many fundamental factors. Moreover, it is desirable for an investor to follow the macroeconomic situation in the world.<br/></br>
How it works? A trader forms a portfolio of several promising and undervalued, in his opinion, coins. The ideal situation would be to create a balanced portfolio of cryptocurrencies, the value of which will not fall and skyrocket. In this case, a beta-neutral portfolio with respect to bitcoin, where half of the coins directly correlates with BTC and grows with its strengthening, and the other half, on the contrary, grows when the price of "digital gold" falls, may become optimal in this case.<br/></br>
Correct rebalancing of such a portfolio will generate income regardless of the general trend in the market. Keep in mind, however, that assets can correlate differently with Bitcoin at different time periods.<br/></br>

    description: `It is very easy to confuse the Last Traded Price with the Market Price for a new user who does not have enough experience in trading. Bitniex has created a dictionary of price terminology that will help novice traders understand.<br/></br>
<b>Limit price:</b> your desired limit order price or best price. Price dependence on the operation performed. A limit order:<br/></br>
<span style="margin-left: 35px;"><b>buy</b> - executed only at the limit price or lower;</span><br/></br>
<span style="margin-left: 35px;"><b>sell</b> - executed only at the limit price or higher.<br/></br>
<b>Market Price (Taker Price):</b> this is the current price at which an asset or service can be purchased or sold. The market price is the best offer in the order book, which differs for buyers and sellers because the best offer for buyers is the lowest sales order in the book, and the best offer for sellers is the highest purchase offer in the book.<br/></br>
<b>Best Average Market Price</b> is the average price of the best current asks or bids that can fill an order. It will be filled by several opposing orders on the book. A market buy order: several of the lowest asks on the book, a market sell order: several of the highest bids on the book. The average price for filling a market order is the best average price.<br/></br>
<b>Last Traded Price:</b> price for executing the last order in the market. For example, if the last XBTUSD trade was at 10127, then 10127 will be The Last Traded Price. This is a purely historical price, and the market order will not be executed on it.<br/></br>

    title: "Pump&Dump",
    description: `Having chosen an exchange and a coin, the organizers buy tokens in small portions so as not to provoke a premature rise in the rate. As a rule, these are little-known cryptocurrencies with a low capitalization, in the common people known as shitcoins. Sometimes relatively large cryptocurrencies are used for pump&dump.<br/></br>
After the purchase of the token, the pump starts - its "pumping". In messengers, news feeds, social networks and exchange chats, the rapid growth of the rate is announced and the name of the exchange platform is announced, where the organizers of the scam place and take large orders for the purchase of a token through their bots, raising its quotation. This is the first pump wave.<br/></br>
Most of the major Bitcoin exchanges restrict this activity, and the coins on their listing are rarely suitable for the scheme. But there are popular platforms that support more than two hundred coins - they are the ones that attract scammers in the first place.<br/></br>
Fake news feeds about partnerships, investments, or technology updates are used to warm up buyers. Paid "experts" are connected to the disinformation campaign. "Sensational" information is disseminated mainly through Telegram channels. Moreover, most of these channels directly report the pump, promising profit.<br/></br>
After that, investors are sure: since they know about the pump in advance, they can make money. In fact, they are already victims, and some of them even pay to subscribe to such pump channels.<br/></br>
In the event of a successful advertising campaign, the second wave of the pump begins - third-party investors come and independently influence the growth of the rate. Amid the excitement, the price rises, the organizers sell tokens at an inflated value, after which the cryptocurrency rate returns to its original indicators.<br/></br>

<span style='margin-left: 25px;'>Spot Trading</span><br/></br>
This type of trading occurs in the spot market at the current price. When you are engaged in spot trading, you make a deal at an affordable bid and ask price, which is requested by other market participants. To complete a trade, you need to have available assets to pay for the trade by the settlement date. For example, if you are going to make a purchase of BTC in the amount of $1,500, then you must make a deposit by the date of settlement of at least the specified amount. Usually the date is calculated according to the T + 2 trading day scheme. Otherwise, the exchange will refuse to enter the Bitcoin position.<br/></br>
<b style='margin-left: 25px;'>Margin Trading</b><br/></br>
With margin trading, you borrow funds from a third party to increase your position. Margin and spot trading are different. With margin trading, you do not need the full amount of the transaction to open a position, you just need to have assets that will be on the margin of the position you are going to open. For example, you are going to buy BTC for $1000. Some platforms are ready to provide you with up to 100x leverage. That is, you only need $10 on your account to trade Bitcoin for $1,000 BTC. To keep a position open, you only need to hold 1% (with 100x leverage) of the contract amount. Depending on the course of the trade, you can open even more positions or withdraw profits.<br/></br>
<b style='margin-left: 25px;'>What to choose?</b><br/></br>
<b>Spot Trading: benefits</b> Management of risks: trading occurs only with your own balance, which you actually own, that is, the impossibility of going into a negative. Guarantee: spot trading takes place only on own assets. In this way, the exchange ensures that you avoid over-leveraging.
<b>Spot Trading: limitations</b> Missed trading opportunities: even with confidence in the deal, you will not be able to earn 100% or more, you will only be able to earn the amount that your capital allows.
<b>Margin Trading: benefits</b> Possibility of increasing profits: the presence of leverage allows you to increase your trade up to 100 times in comparison with your capital. Low-frequency trading: an increased likelihood of trades identified in this type of trading.
<b>Margin Trading: limitations</b> Risks: Opportunity to lose more money than the initial investment. Liquidation: complete liquidation of a position with insufficient funds to cover losses.<br/></br>
<b style='margin-left: 25px;'>What strategy should you follow?</b><br/></br>
It all depends on your usual trading style and your character: are you tolerant of risks, what knowledge about investing you have. Choose the strategies that are right for you.

    title: "Technical Analysis",
    description: `If you want to get into crypto trading, you better learn at least the basics of technical analysis. While looking at charts, drawing lines, and identifying key price levels may seem silly at first glance, it is actually one of the best weapons you can have at your disposal, and it is definitely better than having nothing.<br/><br/>
True, key levels and prices largely follow established methods of technical analysis, but crypto trading is a rebellious Wild West: volatility, markets move quickly, and they are more prone to price manipulation. Hence, the knowledge base that you might bring from other markets must be adapted to the cryptocurrency through your own experiences, lessons, drastic and decisive actions, and appropriate risk management techniques.<br/><br/>
<b>While it may sound daunting, cryptocurrency combined with adequate TA techniques can lead to many profitable opportunities.</b><br/><br/>
If you are quick-witted and vigilant about your trades and strategies, you are likely to have a fun and profitable pastime.<br/><br/>

    title: "What is BTC (Bitcoin)?",
    description: `Bitcoin is a reward for the work done in the form of a code.
Bitcoin is the world's first cryptocurrency (decentralized digital currency). This currency is fundamentally different from all previously created electronic currencies and payment systems. It is not tied to any physical assets or official currencies, and the price of a digital coin - bitcoin - is governed solely by market supply and demand.
Bitcoin is also a worldwide payment system through which transactions with this currency can be carried out. Its main difference from traditional payment systems is that the Bitcoin system does not have any control and processing center - all transactions take place exclusively in a network of equal clients.`,

    title: "What is BCH (Bitcoin Cash)?",
    description: `Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency, a fork of Bitcoin that split from it. Forking from the main branch occurred on August 1, 2017. In 2018, Bitcoin SV peer-to-peer payment system branched off from Bitcoin Cash.
Any user who had Bitcoin at the time of the fork became the owner of an equivalent amount of Bitcoin Cash. To prevent double-spending, Bitcoin Cash transactions use a new signature hashing algorithm that is not valid on the Bitcoin Legacy network. This prevents replay of Bitcoin Cash transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain and vice versa.
The main difference from the "parent" cryptocurrency is the larger block size (8 MB instead of 1 MB), which favorably affects the speed of operations.
So what are the main differences between BCH and BTC? The new currency operates on a protocol similar to bitcoin: SHA-256 hash calculation algorithm; the same reward system and Proof of Work consensus; the same "ceiling" of emission - no more than 21 million coins can be issued But there are also a few key differences: the main difference is the block size increased by 8 times, up to 8 megabytes; the complexity change scheme is different: it does not change every 2016 blocks, like BTC, but every 6 Both currencies use the same Blockchain. Block number 478558 is the last of the common for both projects: the next one, 478559, is generated both in the BTC network and in BCH, but in different formats, which are mutually discarded by the blockchain branches of the "old" bitcoin and its fork. Thus, block 478559 became the first in the history of BCH.
Of the minor innovations of a technical nature, which also give an advantage, it can be noted: implementation of protection against erasure of transactions and their replay; a special type of transaction, where the user is given the opportunity to sign separately the amount of transfers, making payments safe

    title: "What is ETH (Ethereum)?",
    description: `Ethereum is a decentralized platform with smart contracts: applications that work exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference.
These applications run on a custom blockchain, an extremely powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value and represent property ownership.
This allows developers to create markets, keep registers of debts or promises, transfer funds according to instructions given in the past (like a will or a futures contract) and many other things that have not yet been invented, all without a middle man or counterparty risk.
Ether is a necessary element - fuel - for the operation of the Ethereum distributed application platform. It is a form of payment made by clients of the platform for machines performing the requested transactions. In other words, ether is an incentive to ensure that developers write quality applications (wasteful code costs are greater) and that the network remains healthy (people are compensated for their resources).

As you know, blockchain has a number of advantages over traditional financial institutions as it offers cheap, fast, unlimited transactions without intermediaries. However, the volatility of exchange rates on the blockchain does not allow them to become widespread.
The company combines the technology used by bitcoin with fiat currencies to take advantage of blockchain technology using a currency backed by the US Treasury or the European Central Bank. According to CEO Reeve Collins, the company is digitizing the dollar and bringing that digital dollar to the blockchain.

    title: "Day Trading",
    description: `Day traders are people who live off trading cryptocurrencies and spend most of their time trading. Whether it's buying or selling assets, margin trading or swapping perpetual contracts, they make a dozen different trades every day, hoping to catch favorable price movements. The rewards can be overwhelming, but it can be a little daunting for newbies - especially if you don't know much about technical and fundamental analysis or have little experience in the markets. It can take months or even years of loss before you truly become a successful day trader.
In the cryptocurrency market, day traders have to stick to charts and watch price movements closely. Be prepared to cut losses, break even, and switch frequently to avoid bull or bear traps and losses. As a day trader, you have to befriend cryptocurrency price fluctuations and literally live by them no matter which direction the market is heading. There is a counter trade for every price movement at the pivot point, which is a great opportunity to increase the amount.
Day trading is fast and accurate solutions designed to minimize risk and maximize your profits.Of course, no trader can be 100% right, so be prepared to close positions even with significant losses. Learn to identify possible levels of support and resistance, re-enter your trades at the right time, set targets and also set stop loss, and sooner or later you will develop your day trader skill.

    title: "Creation of a crypto portfolio",
    description: `This sophisticated cryptocurrency trading strategy is based on assessing the state of the cryptocurrency market. To use it effectively, it is necessary not only to monitor the situation on the cryptocurrency market, but also to take into account many fundamental factors. Moreover, it is desirable for an investor to follow the macroeconomic situation in the world.
How it works? A trader forms a portfolio of several promising and undervalued, in his opinion, coins. The ideal situation would be to create a balanced portfolio of cryptocurrencies, the value of which will not fall and skyrocket. In this case, a beta-neutral portfolio with respect to bitcoin, where half of the coins directly correlates with BTC and grows with its strengthening, and the other half, on the contrary, grows when the price of "digital gold" falls, may become optimal in this case.
Correct rebalancing of such a portfolio will generate income regardless of the general trend in the market. Keep in mind, however, that assets can correlate differently with Bitcoin at different time periods.

    title: "Price Terms",
    description: `It is very easy to confuse the Last Traded Price with the Market Price for a new user who does not have enough experience in trading. Bitniex has created a dictionary of price terminology that will help novice traders understand.
Limit price: your desired limit order price or best price. Price dependence on the operation performed. A limit order:
buy - executed only at the limit price or lower;
sell - executed only at the limit price or higher.
Market Price (Taker Price): this is the current price at which an asset or service can be purchased or sold. The market price is the best offer in the order book, which differs for buyers and sellers because the best offer for buyers is the lowest sales order in the book, and the best offer for sellers is the highest purchase offer in the book.
Best Average Market Price is the average price of the best current asks or bids that can fill an order. It will be filled by several opposing orders on the book. A market buy order: several of the lowest asks on the book, a market sell order: several of the highest bids on the book. The average price for filling a market order is the best average price.
Last Traded Price: price for executing the last order in the market. For example, if the last XBTUSD trade was at 10127, then 10127 will be The Last Traded Price. This is a purely historical price, and the market order will not be executed on it.`,

    title: "Pump&Dump",
    description: `Having chosen an exchange and a coin, the organizers buy tokens in small portions so as not to provoke a premature rise in the rate. As a rule, these are little-known cryptocurrencies with a low capitalization, in the common people known as shitcoins. Sometimes relatively large cryptocurrencies are used for pump&dump.
After the purchase of the token, the pump starts - its "pumping". In messengers, news feeds, social networks and exchange chats, the rapid growth of the rate is announced and the name of the exchange platform is announced, where the organizers of the scam place and take large orders for the purchase of a token through their bots, raising its quotation. This is the first pump wave.
Most of the major Bitcoin exchanges restrict this activity, and the coins on their listing are rarely suitable for the scheme. But there are popular platforms that support more than two hundred coins - they are the ones that attract scammers in the first place.
Fake news feeds about partnerships, investments, or technology updates are used to warm up buyers. Paid "experts" are connected to the disinformation campaign. "Sensational" information is disseminated mainly through Telegram channels. Moreover, most of these channels directly report the pump, promising profit.
After that, investors are sure: since they know about the pump in advance, they can make money. In fact, they are already victims, and some of them even pay to subscribe to such pump channels.
In the event of a successful advertising campaign, the second wave of the pump begins - third-party investors come and independently influence the growth of the rate. Amid the excitement, the price rises, the organizers sell tokens at an inflated value, after which the cryptocurrency rate returns to its original indicators.

    title: "Deposit Wrong Crypto",
    description: `<b style='margin-left: 25px;'>What Should I Do If Deposit Wrong Crypto?</b><br/>
A crypto address is a string of characters that can be used to send and receive crypto. While each coin typically has its own unique address, coins on the same blockchain may have the same. For instance, all ERC20 tokens on BitConvex have the same address. Note that depositing coins to a non-matching address may result in the loss of your funds.<br/>
This article shows the common mistakes of depositing the wrong crypto, and what to do to recover your funds in the event of such a mistake. Common Mistakes of Depositing Wrong Crypto:<br/>
<b>1. Depositing coins that have not been listed on BitConvex</b></br/>
Though <b>BitConvex</b> supports Bitcoin and over 100+ altcoins, there are still many coins that have not been listed yet. Coins that have not been listed yet will not be displayed on <b>BitConvex</b> when deposited.<br/><br/>
<b>2. Depositing coin A to the address of coin B</b><br/>
Unless both coins are issued on the same blockchain, it is very likely that the deposit will fail to go through. For instance, a Bitcoin address will not accept deposits in ETH. The same goes for most other coins.<br/><br/>
<b>3. Depositing a coin to the wrong network</b><br/>
Certain coins (such as USDT and ETH) support multiple blockchain networks on BitConvex. Ensure the network selected matches the network of the address entered.
For instance, only the mainnet of EWT is supported on BitConvex, meaning that ERC20 deposits will fail to go through.<br/><br/>
<b>4. Depositing coins with a different contract address</b><br/>
Blockchain projects may upgrade the contract address of their token for certain reasons. <b>BitConvex</b> will publish an official announcement if we support the upgrade. Once the upgrade has been completed, deposits to the old contract address will not be credited to your <b>BitConvex</b> account.<br/><br/>
<b>5. Deposit coins to the contract address</b><br/>
Note that the contract address is not used for deposit and withdrawal. Transfers to the contract address will not be recoverable. You can always find the deposit address from the <b>BitConvex</b> deposit page.<br/><br/>
<b style='margin-left: 25px;'>2. What To Do When Depositing the Wrong Crypto</b><br/><br/>
<b>1. Collect the following information.</b><br/><br/>
<p style='margin-left: 25px;'>Your BitConvex UID and registered email address.<br/>
The name and the amount of the coins you deposited.<br/>
The TXID of the transaction.<br/>

    title: "KYC verification",
    description: `<b style='margin-left: 25px;'>KYC - Know Yout Customer.</b><br/>
The KYC process includes submitting and verifying documents that serve as your identity proofs. They mention your date of birth, address, and other essential details. KYC is a fundamental practice to protect an organization from fraud and losses resulting from illegal funds and transactions.<br/><br/>
<b style='margin-left: 25px;'>Important information:</b><br/>
To avoid conditions such as forgetting access credentials to exchange and accounts being taken over by others (information leakage from client side), we strongly suggest you to complete the KYC verification. Through the KYC information, we could help recover your account more quickly; Currently the same account only supports one authentication status, can not both be certified at the same time.<br/><br/>
<b style="margin-left: 25px;">How to pass KYC(Identity Verification)</b><br/>
Go to the home page, click on the "Sign up" button and complete the registration procedure. Confirm your email, click on the tab "Settings" and follow the link "Click here to verify your ID" Fill out the data for the verification, you will get the status "Under review". Verification of documents takes up to 24 hours. After checking the documents you will see the message "Your ID information has been verified". After passing the verification, you will receive increased withdrawal limits and a deposit bonus.

    title: "Account Security Guide",
    description: `<b style='margin-left: 25px;'>2FA and backup code</b><br/>
Enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) increases the security of your BitConvex Account, as well as coins/tokens stored on It. This method of account protection is called two-factor protection, because it is the second security barrier after the password to log in to the account. This really increases your security, because in addition to the username and password, the attacker will need to enter a 2FA-code. In the event of a hacking attempt, an attacker can reset your password through your e-mail address that you specified during registration, if it was hacked. However, even if the attacker has a username and password from your BitConvex account
 
<b style='margin-left: 25px;'>Password</b><br/>
Several rules for creating a password:<br/>
The password has never been used before;<br/>
The minimum length is 6 characters;<br/>
Use upper and lower case;<br/>
Use special characters and numbers.<br/><br/>
 
<b style='margin-left: 25px;'>HTTP(S)</b><br/>
Check the "S" after "http" in the browser's address bar. If there is no "S", the connection is not secure. It can lead to loss of access to the account and loss of funds. A green lock near the address informs the user about the security of the visited page. If there is no lock, you should pay special attention to the site name in the address bar or do not use it at all, because the http Protocol is not secure. It is safe to use websites with https Protocol only.
 
<b style='margin-left: 25px;'>Checking the SSL certificate</b><br/>
To check the SSL certificate, follow the instructions. Click on the certificate details and make sure that you are on the official website.

    title: "Anti-Fraud Guide",
    description: `<b style='margin-left: 25px;'>1. Account information</b><br/>
BitConvex support will not require anyone for any login information, payment password, Google authentication code, or private key in any name. Any requests of this nature are fraudulent.<br/><br/>

<b style="margin-left: 25px;">2. Account/devices access</b><br/>
Never give access to your account and the funds stored on it to a third-party. BitConvex will never request remote access to your account or your devices.

<b style="margin-left: 25px;">3. Phishing</b><br/>
Phishing scammers can copy official e-mails on behalf of the BitConvex exchange. Scammers may request confidential data via e-mail that compromises your account data, as well as your personal data that helps to identify you. Fraudsters can also attach links to change the phone number and password. Links of this nature may redirect you to a third-party fraudulent website or contain malware. Therefore, never click on links and do not give your data to third-parties.<br/>
Common types of phishing scam:<br/><br/>
<b>Spear</b> Phishing is based on personalized communication in order to gain the user's trust;<br/><br/>
<b>Clone Phishing</b> - copying a legitimate e-mail containing an attachment or link of a fraudulent version. The e-mail is sent from a masked address;<br/><br/>
<b>Whaling</b> - targeted at senior executives or senior people within the company. It usually looks like a legitimate concern, subpoena, client issue, or corporate matter;<br/><br/>
<b>SMiShing</b> - fraud using text or SMS. It looks like a confirmation of account activity.<br/>
Often, fraudulent e-mails come as spam because they do not pass DKIM/SPF verification.<br/><br/>
<b>Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM)</b> technology allows a company to vouch for an e-mail message that is sent. Technically  this is a method of confirming the sender's domain through a cryptographic signature.<br/><br/>
<b>The Sender Policy Framework (SPF)</b> technology is another way to identify the sender of an email and provides an additional option to filter the mail stream for spam messages.
